We are working on biomedical abstracts. Within these abstracts, authors will often define an abbreviation that they
are going to use throughout the text. For instance one abstract may state “Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are
frequently misdiagnosed due to the …”. In this case CF is being defined as an abbreviation of cystic fibrosis. I will
give you an abstract, and you will tell me all of the abbreviations being defined and the exact string from the
abstract that is being abbreviated. In the case that an abbreviation occurs in the definition of another abbreviation,
fully expand all of the definitions.  Return your results as a JSON array of objects with two keys:
- "abbreviation": the abbreviation being defined
- "definition": the exact string from the abstract that is being abbreviated
